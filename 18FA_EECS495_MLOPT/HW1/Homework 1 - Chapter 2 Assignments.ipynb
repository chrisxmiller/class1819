    "$\\textbf{Lesson Learned:}$ if $\\vec{w}$ is constantly increasing, then it's probably centered about $[0,1)$, bounding $w_1 \\times w_2$ to the $1^{st}$ quadrant in a 2D carteasian space. This will mean that $\\vec{w}$ can only increase in magnitude and you'll *never* converge. To fix this and save four hours of debugging, the random function should follow $rand \\in [-1,1)$ which is found by $2*(rand - 0.5)$."
