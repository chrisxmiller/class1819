# Programming Classes FA18-WI19-SP19 - Northwestern University - Chris Miller
Generic repository for programming-based classes taken at Northwestern during the FA18-SP19 window. 
Not intended to distribute answers or share solutions.

Personal note: 
Feel free to use this as a guide for "I'm stuck on a line of code" help. Do not copy solutions - that's cheating and violates multiple academic integrity policies. If I could make this private, for free, I would. If you need help, just ask! Also, I'm not the best programmer, copying my code is probably a horrible idea.
